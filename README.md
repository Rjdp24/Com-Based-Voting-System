# Computer Based Voting System


## Overview

This project aims to develop a Computer Based Voting System using a combination of technologies including **HTML, CSS, PHP** and a little bit of basic **JavaScript,** working on local server **Apache** and using **MySQL** as the database, accessing them through _*XAMPP Control Panel*_. The system is designed to streamline and secure the voting process, providing a user-friendly interface for voters and efficient management for administrators. This project was made as a **major project** for completion of the BCA 6th Semester. It is also used for conducting _*Student's Union Election*_ at **Tinsukia College**.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Markup language for creating the structure of web pages. 
- **CSS:** Styling language to enhance the visual presentation of the web pages.
- **PHP:** Server-side scripting language for dynamic content generation and server interactions.
- **JavaScript:** Client-side scripting language for interactive features and enhanced user experience.
- **MySQL:** Relational database management system for storing and managing voting data.
- **Apache:** Web server software for hosting and serving the application.


## Development Environment

The project is developed and tested on the _*XAMPP control panel,*_ providing an integrated environment for **PHP, MySQL, and Apache. XAMPP** ensures easy setup and configuration, making it convenient for both development and deployment.


## Features

1. **User Registration:** Allows voters to register with their details securely.
2. **Authentication:** Ensures secure login for registered voters.
3. **Voting Interface:** Intuitive interface for users to cast their votes.
4. **Results Display:** Real-time display of voting results for administrators.
5. **Admin Panel:** Provides administrators with tools to manage candidates and posts, monitor voting progress, and handle any system-related tasks.


## Drawbacks

- **Responsiveness** is a major drawback. I will try and make it responsive with the upcoming versions of this project.
- **Tech Stack** used in it is quite outdated. XAMPP is used to build this project. If tech stack is not one of your major concerns, feel free to use it.
